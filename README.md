/// Introduction

Hey there, big old blue sphere! 
Hello, dear oxygen consuming native of the water planet!

I hope you are well and in good health.
My name is Robin and do not know enough, but I'm more than happy to learn new things.
For instance I started out as an illustrator and animator, and now I dare to call myself a full blown game developer.

Yet again - now here - I find myself on the cusp of another brand new, unexplored horizon filled with knowledge!
But more importantly, probably no place for overdramatic and useless introductions.


Ironically, all this wholeheartedly encompasses my story. 
I can promise you that I will never fly too close to the sun (your flaming neighbor, y'know?) - it's pretty much a guarantee that I get sidetracked rather quickly and will take the longest route. But (hey!) you know what they say; "It's about the journey.. and stuff!" 


What was I talking about? Oh right I was doing the tutorial.. Hold on I'm back on track! 
Sorry, earth breather, gotta go!
